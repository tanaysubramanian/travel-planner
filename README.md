# Travel Planner

In this project, I designed a program that plans a custom travel route based on a user's needs. This program can read in a travel graph and output an optimal route for the user in any one of 3 priorities: price (cheapest route), time (shortest travel time), and directness (least connections). I implemented Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to determine the route for the priorities of price and time. I implemented Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the path for the priority of directness.
