# Travel Planner

In this project, I designed a program which plans a custom travel route based on a user's needs. This program can read in a travel graph and output an optimal route for the user in any one of 3 priorities: price (cheapest route), time (shortest travel time), and directness (least connections). I implemented Dijkstraâ€™s and Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms to find paths with and without an edge weight.
